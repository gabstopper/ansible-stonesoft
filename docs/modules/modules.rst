Modules

Modules provide the functionality to add, modify and remove elements within the Stonesoft Management Center. Each module focuses on a specific
functionality allowing playbooks to be designed in a modular way. Not all modules provide the ability to modify elements, be sure to
review the documentation. 

Modules by default will preset the state to 'present' indicating a create operation. To remove, modify the state to 'absent'.
